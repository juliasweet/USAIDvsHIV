Revisiting USAID vs. WBI project; see ReadMe

One significant limitation of the USAID vs. WBI project was that we did not narrow funding by project/target. Put another way, we looked at all aid that went to a country in a given year. Though we did separate by general category (economic vs. military), we did not isolate by the specific agency or project that received and disbursed the funding or aid. 

In this revisitation of the project, I am examining the impact of funding that went to HIV/AIDS reduction projects and the rate of HIV/AIDS in people ages 15-44. I plan to begin by looking at total aid for each project, organized by country and year. Depending on the results, I may examine specific agencies and projects more closely. 

Note: While I have left the notebook with my initial cleaning of the USAID data, I have not included the USAID file. It is large enough that it would consume more than half of my available storage and bandwith. The complete data set is available for download at the USAID web site.
